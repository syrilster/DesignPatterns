## Spring Boot
* Spring boot Dev tools: recognises what class loader is this being loaded by and will disable any functionality is production environment. Ex: If app run using java -jar.
* Add a macro for keymap cntrl + S so that each time you press it Spring Boot dev tools will restart the project quickly. This is for rapid development.
* Spring boot dev tools has a seperate class loader for the changed files so that this can be loaded seperately.
