## What is JPA?
* Java Persistence API introduced in JavaEE 5, a new standard for persistence.
* Java objects to get the required SQL statements to fetch values from DB.
* Hibernate was invented by Gavin King to overcome the problem of javaee entity beans.
* Hibernate did not follow any specific standard and it was developed initially for JBoss.
* JavaEE 5 takes on Hibernate by providing standards called JPA.

## Java Data Access
* JDBC - Very low level. (Requires lot of boiler plate code)

## Implementations of JPA
* Hibernate remains a leading implementation.
* EclipseLink (used to be TopLink by Oracle).
* Apache OpenJPA

## JPA Notations
* POJO having @Entity annotation.
* Id annotation for the primary key mapping.
* No arg constructor required for JPA's new instances.
