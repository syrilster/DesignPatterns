**Monolithic application** - Has various system capabilities providing a plethora of services at one place.

**Microservices** - Each of the above capabilites is put as a seperate process. And instead of having one single process, have a network of communicating processes. Example a unix command: ps -ef | grep java. Multiple unix commands communicating using a pipe command.
