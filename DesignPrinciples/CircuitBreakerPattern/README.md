## The problem
* In a distributed environment, calls to remote resources and services can fail due to transient faults, such as slow network connections, timeouts, or the resources being overcommitted or temporarily unavailable. These faults typically correct themselves after a short period of time, and a robust cloud application should be prepared to handle them by using a strategy such as the Retry pattern.
* However, there can also be situations where faults are due to unanticipated events, and that might take much longer to fix. These faults can range in severity from a partial loss of connectivity to the complete failure of a service. In these situations it might be pointless for an application to continually retry an operation that is unlikely to succeed, and instead the application should quickly accept that the operation has failed and handle this failure accordingly.
* In the case of cloud services, the goal is to allow a cloud application to continue to function to the degree possible when a service outage occurs in only part of the application. Achieving this goal becomes more complicated as complex applications are built by using many microservices.

* The Circuit Breaker pattern is a framework that provides a graceful degradation of service rather than a total service failure.
