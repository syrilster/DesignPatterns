* Inheritance: "IS-A" kind of a relationship. To reuse functionality across different classes.
* Interface: A java interface provides an abstraction. Implementations of this interface which do not exposed any other methods are employing information hiding; we cannot tell how they are implemented.
    Using an interface we can define the specification which can be implemented later. Example: JPA is an interface and hibernate or eclipselink will implement it in their own way.
