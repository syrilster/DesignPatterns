DataReplication by BackBlaze data storage provider.

## Data replication
* Data uploaded onto Backblaze's data center is sharded into 17 data shards plus three parity shards for each file. 
* Parity shard bits are computed by the Reedâ€“Solomon error correction algorithm. 
* The shards are stored in 20 storage pods, each in a separate cabinet to increase resilience to a power loss to an entire cabinet. Backblaze states that its Vault architecture is designed with 99.99999% annual durability.[9]
