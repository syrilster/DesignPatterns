## Object oriented design
Indications of Bad code:
* Rigid - Too many methods depend on the same function. So a change to one method causes inconsistency across other methods too. (i.e cannot make an isolated change)
* Fragile - One code change starts breaking other functionality. (i.e code starts to break in other modules which has no relationship to your change so its unpredictable).
* Coupling - Tight coupling between high level and low level modules.
