## Why Cloud Storage?
* Availability: The motto of cloud storage services is to have data availability anywhere anytime. Users can access their files/photos from any device whenever and wherever they like.
* Reliability and Durability: Another benefit of cloud storage is that it offers 100% reliability and durability of data. Cloud storage ensures that users will never lose their data, by keeping multiple copies of the data stored on different geographically located servers.
* Scalability: Users will never have to worry about getting out of storage space. With cloud storage, you have unlimited storage as long as you are ready to pay for it.
