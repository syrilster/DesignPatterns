## What is a Rate Limiter?
Imagine weâ€™ve a service which is receiving a huge number of requests, but it can only serve a limited number of requests per second. 
To handle this problem, we would need some kind of throttling or rate limiting mechanism that will allow only a certain number of requests which our service can respond to. A rate limiter, at a high-level, limits the number of events an entity (user, device, IP, etc.) can perform in a particular time window. For example:

* A user can send only one message per second.
* A user is allowed only three failed credit card transactions per day.
* A single IP can only create twenty accounts per day.

In general, a rate limiter caps how many requests a sender can issue in a specific time window. It then blocks requests once the cap is reached.
