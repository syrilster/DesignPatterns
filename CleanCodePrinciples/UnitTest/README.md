## Fundamental principle of Unit Testing
* **Verify that a known, fixed input produces a known, fixed output.** Example when testing a function which calculates the square root, pass an input as 9 as everybody knows that the output should be 3. Don't try to pass a input as 2 as the output is in decimals and nobody is sure of it. (Atleast after 4 decimal points !!)
