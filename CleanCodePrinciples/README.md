## Functions
* Should be small - Ideally 4 or 5 lines long !!
* Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.
* After all. the reason we write function is to decompose a larger concept into a set of steps at the next level of abstraction.
* **One level of abstraction per function** - we need to make sure that statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction. Never mix concepts which are at a very high level of abstracion such as getHtml(); others that are low level, such as .append("\n").
