## Requirements and Goals of the System

**Functional Requirements:**

* Users should be able to upload videos.
* Users should be able to share and view videos.
* Users can perform searches based on video titles.
* Our services should be able to record stats of videos, e.g., likes/dislikes, total number of views, etc.
* Users should be able to add and view comments on videos.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

* The system should be highly reliable, any video uploaded should not be lost.
* The system should be highly available. Consistency can take a hit (in the interest of availability), if a user doesnâ€™t see a video for a while, it should be fine.
* Users should have real time experience while watching videos and should not feel any lag.

Not in scope: Video recommendation, most popular videos, channels, and subscriptions, watch later, favorites, etc.
