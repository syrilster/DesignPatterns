Queues are used to effectively manage requests in a large-scale distributed system. In small systems with minimal processing loads and small databases, writes can be predictably fast; however, in more complex and large systems writes can take an almost non-deterministically long time. For example, data may have to be written in different places on different servers or indices, or the system could simply be under high load. In such cases where individual writes (or tasks) may take a long time, achieving high performance and availability requires different components of the system to work in an asynchronous way; a common way to do that is with queues.

**JMS (ActiveMQ is a JMS broker implementation)** can be used as a mechanism to allow asynchronous request processing. You may wish to do this because the request take a long time to complete or because several parties may be interested in the actual request. Another reason for using it is to allow multiple clients (potentially written in different languages) to access information via JMS. ActiveMQ is a good example here because you can use the STOMP protocol to allow access from a C#/Java/Ruby client.
