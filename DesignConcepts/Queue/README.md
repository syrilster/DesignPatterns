Queues are used to effectively manage requests in a large-scale distributed system. In small systems with minimal processing loads and small databases, writes can be predictably fast; however, in more complex and large systems writes can take an almost non-deterministically long time. For example, data may have to be written in different places on different servers or indices, or the system could simply be under high load. In such cases where individual writes (or tasks) may take a long time, achieving high performance and availability requires different components of the system to work in an asynchronous way; a common way to do that is with queues.
